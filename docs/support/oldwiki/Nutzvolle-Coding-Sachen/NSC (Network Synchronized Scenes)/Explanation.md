# What the Heck Are NSCs?

NSCs, short for Network Synchronized Scenes, are typically animations that involve multiple players or props. Examples of NSCs include activities like kidnapping or extracting a tooth in GTA Online. If you're using RageMP, there's an incredibly useful tutorial on how to use NSCs, and this wiki aims to document the available NSCs and provide example code (you can find the link in the sources).

## Important Note!
Not all Synchronized Scenes are actually synchronized. This means that regular animations can also be played using this feature.

# Structure
Within the "Examples" folder, you'll find one video and one example code for each NSC. The headings and tags serve as explanations for what they represent, for instance:

`creatures@shark@melee@streamed_core@ + attack` becomes "shark attack" since it represents the GTA Online shark attack animation. These headings are written in English for documentation purposes.
