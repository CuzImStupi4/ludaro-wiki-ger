Hello! im Ludaro! and here is a small Text to explain how you can translate this biki the best way,

DE is the regular language thats used, because well... ludaro.**de** exists for a reason, and im german so yeah. lol

if you want to translate a page, you can do so by clicking on the "Edit this page" button on the top right of the page, and then you can translate the page in the editor.

but if you want to translate something on the mainpage, you need to edit the code.json, thats also why for de this exists, because the main page has no default translation, 

but the whole wiki is in german as default and english is stored in docurausus-theme-content-docs

and docusuaurs-theme-classic is the footer and navbar (which are default in german aswell)

yay! thank you for contibruting you are awesome here are some hearts for you ðŸ’•
