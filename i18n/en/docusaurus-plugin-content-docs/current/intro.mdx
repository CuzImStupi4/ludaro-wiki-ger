# Welcome!

:::caution Preliminary Information:

This wiki does not contain direct recommendations or advertisements, and it never will. I started this wiki as a hobby project, and it will remain so. Its purpose is not to support anyone in marketing or to give an advantage to others or to generate advertisements. Primarily, this wiki is intended to make FiveM scripting easier and more accessible, providing a good place for new server operators to explore and learn. Additionally, the wiki is NOT intended to replace other wikis. In this wiki, I will only cover basic aspects and not go into detail on how to use them, as other wikis typically cover this. Instead, I will provide guides and strive to explain my part as clearly as possible so that even those without "developer knowledge" know what to do.

:::

Hello! My name is Ludaro. I created this wiki to answer questions about learning Lua, specifically for FiveM. The goal is to showcase my skills and helpfulness and efficiently clarify frequently asked questions.

This wiki focuses on presenting the options available to you without evaluating what is better. It is specifically for FiveM Lua and does not cover all possible topics. Many contents are intentionally simplified to maximize readability and make the information more accessible, but they should not neglect the original content.

Would you like to contribute to the wiki? It is completely written in Markdown and available on GitHub. You can edit it as you like [here](https://github.com/Ludaro1024/ludaro-wiki-ger/), have fun exploring and contributing!

If you'd like to support me, feel free to buy me [here](https://buymeacoffee.com/ludaro) a pizza! :)


Please note that this wiki is actively updated in German and Updates in english could take time!
